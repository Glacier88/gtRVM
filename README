Implementation structure:

We use two classes to realize the functionality of 
RVM: 
     Rvmt()  && Transaction()
The former is responsible for managing the mapped
segments and the latter is responsible for managing
undo copies, redo logs and log truncation.

In Rvmt(), two hash tables 
   <segname, segment*> &&  <segbase, segment*>
are used to store information
about the mapped segments. The two hash table have the
same contents but different keys, since the APIs 
requires looks up both by segment name and its address.
